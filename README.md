# Java-Spring

## POJO
* No constraints
* Any Java Object is a POJO.

## Java Bean (EJB)
It must fulfill three conditions - 
* public default (no-arg) constructor.
* getters and setters for all properties.
* It must implement Serializable interface.

## Spring Bean
* Any Java object that is managed by Spring.
* Spring uses IOC container (Bean Factory or Application Context) to manage these objects.
